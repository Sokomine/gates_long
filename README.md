This is a mod for Minetest.

It adds gates that fit well to fences and xconnected nodes.
The passageway through the fence gate is not as slim as with other, existing
mods. Mobs from TenPlus1' version of simple mobs cannot jump over the
closed gate. They can walk through the open gate of course. In order to
keep cattle loss at a minimum, the gate will auto-close using an abm after
about 5 seconds.

Variants for all wood types from default are included, including default:tree.

Crafting:
          steel ingot - wood (or tree) - steel ingot
          (nothing)   - wood (or tree) - (nothing)
